    <h1>WHY GHIBLI?</h1>
    <img id="ghibli1" src="./nics/scene.jpg">
    <p style="color:#070404; ">Hayao Miyazaki, the lead creative force behind many of Ghibli’s works, did not set out to make children’s films with flashy animation. He made complex animated films about what it means to be human.
        When I say Miyazaki made complex films I mean to say that the message of his films didn’t take you by the hand like most Western animated films had done before.
        Miyazaki’s work holds a level of respect for the viewer, allowing them to connect with the emotions of his characters on display and understand the mystical worlds that surround them. In the West there was, and to an extent still is, a mindset that cartoons are designed wholly for children.
